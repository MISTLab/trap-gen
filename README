TRAP (TRansactional Automatic Processor generator) is a tool for the automatic generation of
processor simulators starting from high level descriptions. This means that the developer only
need to provide basic structural information (i.e. the number of registers, the endianess etc.)
and the behavior of each instruction of the processor ISA; this data is then used for the generation
of C++ code emulating the processor behavior. Such an approach consistently eases the developer's
work (with respect to manual coding of the simulator) both because it requires only the specification
of the necessary details and because it forces a separation of the processor behavior from its structure.
The tool is written in Python and it produces SystemC based simulators. With respect to standard
ADL, having the input directly from Python eliminates the need for having an ad-hoc front-end thus
consistently reducing the development effort.

TRAP is mainly composed of three folders:
 -- cxx_writer: consists in the library, used by TRAP backend, for the creation of
                C++ code from Python. This library is self contained, it does not
                depend on the rest of TRAP and it can be useful on its own
 -- trap: contains the processor generator itself.
 -- processors: processor models created to test TRAP

TRAP depends on the NetworkX (https://networkx.lanl.gov/wiki) package for the creation and representation of the decoding tree
(see decoder.py for more details).

COMPILATION

run ./waf configure --with-systemc=YOUR_SYSTEMC_LOCATION and ./waf from the command line

For more details see http://code.google.com/p/trap-gen/wiki/Setup

--------------------------- LICENSING ---------------------------

TRAP tool itself is licensed under the LGPL license; the C++ code composing TRAP
library (to be linked with the generated Instruction Set Simulators) is
composed of both GPL and LGPL code. At configuration time it is possible to
choose to not use GPL code, thus creating an LGPL only library.

The GPL code is the one depending on libbfd, while LGPL code replaces such functionality
by using libelf (with reduced capabilities, though).

For more details on the GPL and LGPL licenses, refer to the COPYING.GPL and COPYING.LGPL
files in TRAP's root folder.
