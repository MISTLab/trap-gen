The BSP added to the cross-compiler in order to be used for the OS-emulation mechanisms of ReSP is composed of:

-- osemu-crt0.S: contains the start routine of the program (the entry point); it is a modified version of file newlib/libgloss/arm/crt0.S. The modification were made in order to eliminate the stack initialization, which is performed by our hardware thread manager component.
-- libcStub.c: contains the stubs for the missing library routines (just placeholders for compilation purposes, the functionality is imlpemented in hardware through OS emulation)
-- vectors.S: contains the exception handler vectors (jumps to the interrupt handler routines); these instruction will be put at address 0
-- osemu.ld: linker script, exactly the same of the output of "ld --verbose" (the original linker script), only modified in order to put the start address at 0 and in order to link the exception vectors.  Note that the symbol _stack is put at 5MB, since we suppose that we have 5 MB of RAM; in case your system is different, change it.
-- osemu.specs: puts everything together, when specifying -specs=osemu.specs on the compiler command line, this file is read in order to identify the start file (osemu-crt0.S), the linker script (osemu.ld) ...

All these files (well, for vectors.S, libcStub.c, and osemu-crt0.S we consider the object file and not the source file) are copied inside arm-elf/lib. In order to use them simple specify -specs=osemu.specs as an additional parameter to gcc when performing the compilation.

Finally file configure.host is the configuration file for the newlib library; with respect to file newlib/newib/configure.host the change is that none of the ARM_RDP_MONITOR or ARM_RDI_MONITOR are used. You have to modify this file before compiling newlib during the creation of the cross-compiler.

File configOptions.txt contains the additional configuration option that were given to the crossCreate.py script in order to create the cross-compiler

It should in theory be possible to use the files in this folder with any recent version of the binutils, gcc and newlib. Anyway they have been tested with: binutils-2.19.tar.bz2 gcc-4.3.3.tar.bz2 gdb-6.8.tar.bz2 newlib-1.17.0.tar.gz
